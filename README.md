# Rollout

 2D Game Project

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rollout is a two-dimensional platform game. The basis of the game process is moving the ball through a moving maze. 
With each level, the complexity of the maze increases, fewer free corridors are generated and the number of dead ends increases.
The player is given a limited number of opportunities to destroy the walls of the maze.
